## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## My practice

Here's some code:
```{r}
dim(iris)
```

Here are options:

By default, eval=T. This evaluates the code. (The code is also printed by default)
```{r eval=T}
dim(iris)
```

But if eval=F, the code will still print but not be evaluated.
```{r eval=F}
dim(iris)
```

You can also evaluate the code in-line, which will print ONLY the results of the code, not the code itself, like this:
Two plus two equals `r 2+2`

By default, echo = T. This prints the code. (The code is also evaluated by default)
```{r echo=T}
dim(iris)
```

But prevent code itself from printing using echo=F:
```{r echo=F}
dim(iris)
```

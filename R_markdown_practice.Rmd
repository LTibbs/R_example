## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## My practice

Here's some code:
```{r}
dim(iris)
```

Here are options:

By default, eval=T. This evaluates the code. (The code is also printed by default)
```{r eval=T}
dim(iris)
```

But if eval=F, the code will still print but not be evaluated.
```{r eval=F}
dim(iris)
```

You can also evaluate the code in-line, which will print ONLY the results of the code, not the code itself, like this:
Two plus two equals `r 2+2`

By default, echo = T. This prints the code. (The code is also evaluated by default)
```{r echo=T}
dim(iris)
```

But prevent code itself from printing using echo=F:
```{r echo=F}
dim(iris)
```

## 9/28/18: in-class exercise:
Data types discussion #3:

1. What attributes does a data frame possess?
Names, dimensions, and class; accessed as names(x), dim(x), and class(x) respectively.
Or, structure (as str(x)) for the whole structure.
I.e., 
```{r}
df<- data.frame(x=1:3, y=c("a","b","c"))
names(df)
dim(df)
class(df)
str(df)
```

2. What does as.matrix() do when applied to a data frame with columns of different types?

```{r}
df.matrix <- as.matrix(df)
df.matrix
```
It coerces into a character matrix so that all columns can be the same type.

3. Can you have a data frame with 0 rows / columns?
```{r}
(df.empty <- data.frame())
```
